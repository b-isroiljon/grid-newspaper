    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <div>
        <p>My name is Brian Holt. I am a resident of Seattle, Washington and live here with my wife, son, and dog.</p>
        <p>Currently I work at Stripe as a product manager of developer tools. Before I worked at Microsoft, LinkedIn, Netflix, Reddit, and other smaller companies. I am currently working my masters of business administration degree at Seattle Univeristy</p>
        <p>Here are some interesting accomplishments about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I once won a gaming tournament when I was six. We played Sonic & Knuckles.</li>
            <li>I ate burritos with the band Sugarcult. I don't even like Sugarcult. The burritos are the highlight of this story</li>
            <li>I am one of the very few people to never graduate college nor ever take the standardized test GMAT and yet still be accepted into a master's program.</li>
        </ul>
